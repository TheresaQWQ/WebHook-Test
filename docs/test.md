# 2D feature set

The 2D **feature set**A feature set is a collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific results in the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unity’s Package Manager. [More info](FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Featureset) provides creators of 2D experiences in Unity with features covering Foundations, World-building, Animation, Graphics and Physics. Use the 2D feature set to:

* Import images including multi-layered Photoshop and Aseprite files as **Sprites**A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](Sprites.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Sprite) and configure them for use in 2D games.
* Create freeform, tile-based and spline-based 2D game worlds.
* Create frame-by-frame and bone-based animated characters.
* Use 2D physics to support simulations with **colliders**An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider) and **joints**A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#joint).
* Create a range of 2D art styles, including **pixel**The smallest unit in a computer image. Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel. [More info](ShadowPerformance.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#pixel) art.
